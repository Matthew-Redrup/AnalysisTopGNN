# FourTops
This repo will be used to test the read and write of the FourTops data samples that were created using the Beyond Standard Model group.


Below is a list of tags for each signal sample each of the samples have different mass points as shown below:  

```
DSID	    Mass        Width       Cross-section for ct=1 [pb]
310845	  1 TeV       auto               3.99e-03	 
313346	  1.25 TeV    auto               1.2703e-03	 
310846	  1.5 TeV     auto               4.49e-04	 
310847	  2 TeV       auto               7.02e-05	 
313180	  2.5 TeV     auto               1.3395e-05	 
313181	  3 TeV       auto               2.9508e-06
```

## Some Simple Documentation for the Code: 
- Simply clone the repo 
- ```python main.py ```

So far it only does simple IO using UpRoot and plotting with MatplotLib. Planning on getting a GNN implemented to trial on signal and non signal samples.
