# Some Analysis Strategies to Play Around With
## Single Leptonic (Bruce's Suggestion):
### Selection criteria:
- Assume that the leptonically decaying top is the spectator.
- Assume that the two hardest b-tagged jets (PT) are the Z' resonant tops.
- Match two additional jets to each using $\Delta$R.
- Throw away any remaining jets, these are considered to belong to the second spectator top.

### Fitting Notes:
- Fit the resultant m(Z') distribution


## Double Leptonic:
### Selection Criteria:
- Select the two most energetic children, provided they are quarks.
- Assign either leptons or other children to these two based on the lowest $\Delta$R. 
    - If quarks are lowest $\Delta$R: Use two additional quark children 
    - If lepton is matched: Use single/double neutrino reconstruction code.
- Derive the Top and the resonance mass
