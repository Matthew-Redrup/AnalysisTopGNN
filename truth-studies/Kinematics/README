Shorts:
* Res-Lep: Resonance top decaying leptonically
* Res-Had: Resonance top decaying hadronically
* Spec-Lep: Spectator top decaying leptonically 
* Spec-Had: Spectator top decaying hadronically
* Res: Resonance
* Truth Jets: These are jets that are have no detector inefficiencies applied to them
* Truth Children: These are the immediate decay particles from the truth top. These have not emitted any gluon radiation if they are Quarks.
* Based on TRUTH CHILDREN!: There are two ways of determining whether a top decays leptonically, one being top.Lepton or [ if lepton in top.Children ]. These methods DO NOT necessarily produce the same outcome, .Lepton is the matched DETECTOR lepton to the top.Children. So if a DETECTOR lepton is missing, tops actually decaying leptonically will NOT be considered as such.

-> Figure 4: (x) Not Complete yet....
+Do as above but add deltaR between jet and truth jet 

-> Figure 5: (x) Not Complete yet....
+ Do Bruce Analysis.
+ Selection criteria:
~> Leptonic t: This is spectator 1
~> 2 Hardest b-tagged jets: these correspond to the Z' daughter tops
~> attach two other jets to each <somehow> (I use deltaR)
~> You now have the Z' -> ttbar daughters
~> Remaining jets are your 2nd spectators 
~> Form M(Z')
~> Fit fit M(Z') 

-> Modifications to Bruce's Proposal:
~> Jets have different levels of b-tagging (Working points) (85, 77, 70, 60, 0)
~> Match the emitted lepton to any jet nearby for all working points, regardless of PT hardness
~> Remove the added jet from jet collection 
~> Select two hardest jets (as before) but at different Working points. i.e. jj_{85, 77, 70, 60}_at_jl_{85, 77, 70, 60, 0}
