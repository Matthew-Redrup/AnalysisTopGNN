Shorts:
* Res-Lep: Resonance top decaying leptonically
* Res-Had: Resonance top decaying hadronically
* Spec-Lep: Spectator top decaying leptonically 
* Spec-Had: Spectator top decaying hadronically
* Res: Resonance
* Truth Jets: These are jets that are have no detector inefficiencies applied to them
* Truth Children: These are the immediate decay particles from the truth top. These have not emitted any gluon radiation if they are Quarks.
* Based on TRUTH CHILDREN!: There are two ways of determining whether a top decays leptonically, one being top.Lepton or [ if lepton in top.Children ]. These methods DO NOT necessarily produce the same outcome, .Lepton is the matched DETECTOR lepton to the top.Children. So if a DETECTOR lepton is missing, tops actually decaying leptonically will NOT be considered as such.

-> Figure 1.1:
a: Number of hadronic and leptonically decaying resonance tops (a resonance is classified as hadronic if all tops decay hadronically)
b: Decay channels of the tops, this is an extension of figure a.
c: Mass of Resonance from truth tops - Split into whether the top decays leptonically and hadronically (Top decay channel shouldnt impact the mass, but just to be sure)
d: DeltaR between process truth tops  (Here we check whether the specatator tops are separated from resonance tops)
e: PT Distribution of tops 
f: Energy Distribution of tops

-> Figure 2.1:
a: PDGID of Top Decay products
b: Reconstructed Invariant Top Mass from Children - Divided into Leptonic and Hadronic decay channels
c: Reconstructed Invariant Mass of scalar H resonance - Lep-Lep, Lep-Had, Had-Had
d: DeltaR between children of mutual top (this tests how well the children are clustered) - Split into leptonic and hadronic
e: DeltaR between children and mutual top (tests how much children cluster around the parent top) - Split into leptonic and hadronic
f: DeltaR between adjacent children as a function of parent top PT (we can use this information to see if the resulting jets are possibly merged or produce large-R jets)
g: Fractional Top PT distribution transferred to children - Split by PDGID

-> Figure 3.1:
a: PDGID of Truth Jet parton contributions - These are derived from the GhostPartons that define the truth jet
b. Fraction of parton PT contribution to truth jet
c. DeltaR between parton contributions and truth jet axis
d. Truth Jet PT classified into from top or background
e. Inefficiency of truth jet parton matching based on truth child PDGID (This is based on the truth partons contained in the truth jet.). 
- To elaborate further what this plot tries to demonstrate, it is the percentage lost of each child type. 
- This is calculated by counting the respective top child pdgid and taking the ratio when using truth jet partons matched to the top child. 
- For example; (truth) t -> b + q + qbar this should yield in an ideal world 1 b and 2 q's but from the truth jet partons, this list might only contain b + q, meaning all 'b' were collected, but one of the q's has been lost. 
- A plot of this would therefore have b (0%) and q (50%) (due to the lost qbar). 

#-----\/ --- needs reworking


-> Figure 3.1: Truth Jets 
a: Distribution of n-Truth Jets and n-leptons in event - Stack plot
b: Distribution of n-Truth Jets and n-leptons produced by tops in event. Also included the number of background truth jets (i.e. the truth jets not matched to any top)
c: Distribution of n-Truth Jets excluding the leptonically decaying top (This is based on the TRUTH CHILDREN)
d: DeltaR between truth-jets from common top (This is to test the collimation of the truth jets).
e: DeltaR between top truth jet and background truth jet
f: DeltaR between top truth jets of non-mutual top (checks the combinatorial of truth jets i.e. how far away are truth jets from one top to the other)
g: Number of completely lost tops i.e. the ones without any truth jets being matched.
h: Number of shared truth jets across different tops - i.e. are the truth jets going to be merged.
i: Invariant Mass of Tops derived from Truth Jets - Based on TRUTH CHILDREN!
j: Invariant Mass of Z' Prime when it decays leptonically and purely hadronic - Based on TRUTH CHILDREN!
k: PT Distribution of the truth jets originating from Spectator and Resonance top. (both Res tops need to decay Hadronically)


-> Figure 4: (x) Not Complete yet.... Jets
+Do as above but add deltaR between jet and truth jet 




-> Figure 5: (x) Not Complete yet....
+ Do Bruce Analysis.
+ Selection criteria:
~> Leptonic t: This is spectator 1
~> 2 Hardest b-tagged jets: these correspond to the Z' daughter tops
~> attach two other jets to each <somehow> (I use deltaR)
~> You now have the Z' -> ttbar daughters
~> Remaining jets are your 2nd spectators 
~> Form M(Z')
~> Fit fit M(Z')
